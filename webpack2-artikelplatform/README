Commands
--------

There's shell scripts included if you'd like to run npm in docker like we do.
To use them you can use the commands explained below, if you've a local npm
install and like to use that: feel free ;-) Just replace `bin/npm.sh` by `npm`
and `bin/yarn.sh` by `yarn`.

`bin/yarn.sh install`
`bin/npm run compile`
`bin/npm run build`
